The video reviews **Google’s new Gemini 2.5 Pro model**, calling it *“mind-blowingly fast, smart, and cheap.”* Key points:

### **Gemini 2.5 Pro Highlights**
- **Performance**: Beats GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude, etc., in benchmarks and real-world tasks.
- **Speed**: Exceptionally fast; often responds in under a second.
- **Context Window**: Up to **1 million tokens**, with **2 million** coming soon.
- **Features**: Image parsing, PDF support, image editing, and a “grounded” search feature.
- **Advanced reasoning**: Built-in “thinking” capabilities (in Studio UI only, not exposed via API).

### **Use Cases**
- Parsed 71,000-token HTML blob to extract media links (impressive).
- Can process massive codebases and answer detailed questions quickly.
- Good at math, not yet best-in-class for code (still lags behind Claude and others in complex coding tasks).

### **Why Google is Winning**
- **Data**: Massive trove from running the internet.
- **Science**: Leading researchers and ML experience.
- **Hardware**: Custom chips tailored for inference (like TPU), unlike other companies relying on NVIDIA or external partners.
- **Vertical integration**: Google controls **data, science, hardware, and cloud** (like Apple’s hardware-software synergy).

### **Pricing & Availability**
- **Gemini Flash 2.0** is incredibly cheap (25x cheaper than OpenAI’s models).
- **2.5 Pro** pricing not yet public but expected to be affordable.
- Available now in T3 Chat (with early access for Pro subscribers).

### **Concerns**
- “Thinking steps” visible in Studio but **not in API**—frustrating for developers.
- Google’s AI Studio experience is polished, but rest of Google Cloud still clunky.

### **Conclusion**
Google is dominating due to unmatched integration across all AI stack layers. The speaker praises Gemini 2.5 Pro while also urging Google to expose full model features (like thinking steps) via API.
